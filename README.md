 Plugins for use in VDMX, made with Vuo

## 3Bus_Rollover
This is a Vuo Plugin for VDMX that allows for continuous value changes between 0.0 – 1.0 with rollover.
The plugin has 3 inputs (-1.0 – 1.0) remapped to add or subtract from each of the 3output values on each display refresh.
The plugin is to be used with any feature in VDMX that would be suitable for a continuous "roll", like rotations.
It is recommended to add a mark to the midpoint on the slider in VDMX, to ensure that the value "sticks" to absolute 0, when you do not want any motion at all.
